==Blocks 0 and 2 are still in the cache, but block 1 has never been loaded
==Technically this causes an L1 "hit miss hit" but it is fine if your output file just indicates
==that there was at least one hit and miss ("L1 miss hit" or "L1 hit miss"). The ordering does not matter as long as
==you correctly indicate their presence.
==The important thing is that ALL block hits and misses are reflected in the statistics that are printed at the
==very end of the output file.
